# Sleep Apnea Detector

Sleep apnea is a sleep disorder characterized by repeated interruptions in breathing during sleep. These interruptions, known as apneas, occur when the airway becomes blocked or collapses, leading to temporary pauses in breathing. The most common type of sleep apnea is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), where the muscles at the back of the throat fail to keep the airway open.

These apneas can last for a few seconds to minutes and can happen multiple times throughout the night. As a result, people with sleep apnea often experience poor sleep quality and may feel excessively tired during the day. They may also snore loudly and may wake up gasping for air.

Sleep apnea can have serious consequences if left untreated, including an increased risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, and other health issues. Treatment options for sleep apnea may include lifestyle changes, the use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines, dental devices, or surgery in some cases. If you suspect you or someone you know has sleep apnea, it's important to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and management.

This project aims to develop a sleep apnea detection system using audio signals and MATLAB for signal processing to monitor and analyze breathing patterns during sleep.
## Proposed Solution

Audio Input: Capture sounds during the infant's sleep.

Signal Processing: Analyze breathing patterns and calculate intervals between breaths.

Threshold Setting: Define acceptable breath intervals.

Alert Generation: Send immediate warning to parents if irregular breathing is detected.

Safety Features: Prevent false alarms; ensure data privacy. Audio Input: Capture sounds during the infant's sleep.

Validation: Rigorous testing and continuous updates for optimal performance.

User-Friendly: Intuitive interface for easy setup and customization..

## Components/Software used

* MATLAB with latest version
* Microphone
* Audio signal input (if mic is not used)
